Axis Aligned Collision Detection:
- Show point rectangle Overlap
- Show rectangle rectangle Overlap

Simple Collision Resolution
- Show AABB approach resolving by minimum distance. Show problem with fast moving object frame by frame (or thin overlap)

Raycasting
- Define ray by a point + direction (or P Q with Q = P + ray length)
    - ray can be defined using line function P(t) = P + Dt
- Show Ray Box overlap

Collision Resolution
- Show Sweep AABB
